== Quality Requirements

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all relevant quality requirements.

The most important of these requirements have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals), therefore they should only be referenced here.
In this section 10 you should also capture quality requirements with lesser importance, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved (but might be _nice-to-have_).

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions you should know what qualities are really important for your stakeholders, in a specific and measurable way.

.tpo42 Integration
Quality requirements are primarily defined in req42 Chapter 6 from business perspective. This section adds technical implementation details and architectural scenarios for those business requirements.

Avoid duplicating business quality requirements here - include them from req42 and focus on the technical "how" rather than the business "why".

=== Technical Quality Scenarios

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****

.Content
Technical implementation scenarios for the business quality requirements defined in req42 Chapter 6.
Focus on architectural and implementation details: protocols, algorithms, technical measures.

.Form
For each business quality requirement from req42, define technical scenarios:

Technical Context:: Implementation environment, components affected
Technical Stimulus:: Specific technical trigger or condition
Technical Response:: System behavior in technical terms
Technical Measure:: Measurable technical criteria (response time, throughput, etc.)
