== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider.
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features,
* essential functional requirements,
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

.tpo42 Integration
Consider including high-level requirements from:
* req42 Chapter 3 (Scope): Context and scope boundaries
* req42 Chapter 4 (Product Backlog): Top-level epics and features
* Custom tags for architectural requirements overview

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

_<Include high-level requirements overview here - consider creating custom tags in req42 chapters for architectural perspective>_

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders.
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN-2023.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions.
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

.tpo42 Integration
Select the top 3-5 most architecturally relevant quality goals from req42 Chapter 6 (Quality Requirements). Focus on qualities that directly influence architectural decisions rather than all business quality requirements.

Consider creating a custom tag in req42 Chapter 6 for the architectural subset:
```
//tag::architectural_quality_goals[]
Top architectural quality goals filtered from business requirements
//end::architectural_quality_goals[]
```
****
endif::tpo42help[]

_<Include top 3-5 architectural quality goals here - filter from req42 Chapter 6 Quality Requirements>_

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::tpo42help[]
[role="tpo42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

.tpo42 Integration
Include stakeholders from req42 Chapter 2, but focus on those relevant to architectural decisions and documentation. Consider creating architectural stakeholder tags:
```
//tag::architectural_stakeholders[]
Stakeholders who need to understand, approve, or work with the architecture
//end::architectural_stakeholders[]
```
