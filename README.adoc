== Description

The **Technical Product Owner (TPO)** bridges product management and technical architecture - either a Product Owner with deep technical understanding or an Architect with strong product focus. This role requires balancing business value delivery with architectural excellence.

The **tpo42 Framework** combines two proven methodologies:

* **req42**: Agile requirements engineering framework for stakeholder-focused product development
* **arc42**: Architecture documentation standard for technical decision transparency

=== Concept

Since projects typically start with gathering business ideas, arc42 chapters source content from req42 templates.

[source,adoc]
----
include::../req42-chapters/01_business-goals.adoc[tag=vision]
----

The req42 framework is enhanced at key points with tagged sections:

[source,adoc]
----
//tag::vision[]
=== Vision
Condensed goal summary in one or two (ideally) motivating sentences.
//end::vision[]
----

This follows the Single Source of Truth paradigm where documentation is embedded in code (both at API level via doxygen, javadoc, rst, pod, etc.) as well as requirements and architecture. The approach generally focuses on GitOps and Documentation as Code principles.

=== Framework Structure

Requirements (req42)::
Business goals, stakeholder analysis, product backlog, quality requirements, constraints, domain terminology, teams, and roadmap planning.

Architecture (arc42)::
Introduction and goals, architecture constraints, context and scope, solution strategy, building blocks, runtime and deployment views, cross-cutting concepts, architecture decisions, quality requirements, risks, and glossary.

Integration Benefits::

* Requirements traceability to architectural decisions
* Business context for technical choices
* Stakeholder communication across business and technical domains
* Consistent documentation approach from vision to implementation

=== Target Audience

This framework is designed for experienced practitioners:

* Technical Product Owners managing complex product architectures
* Software Architects involved in product strategy
* Senior Product Managers in technical organizations
* Architecture teams requiring product context
