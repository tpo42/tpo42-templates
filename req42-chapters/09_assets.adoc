== Assets

[role="req42help"]
****
.Content
Under assets we summarize everything that your sponsors or clients give you to enable you as a product owner (together with your team) to do your job successfully.

Assets definitely include time and budget, i.e., resources they give you to do your job. You may have to get your team with these resources yourself, or they may also provide you with staff (your team), workspace, infrastructure, etc.

.Motivation
If you take on the job as a product owner you have to negotiate these assets with your sponsor or client and certainly in the end also account for their use (through hopefully successful results).

In any case, you should know what you have at your disposal in terms of money, personnel, time, infrastructure, ... at your disposal. These assets are an essential boundary condition for your work as a product owner.

.Notations/Tools
Simple lists or tables. For role definitions, consider different formats:
* Simple format: Role description with responsibilities
* RACI matrix: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
* CAIRO matrix: Consulted, Accountable, Informed, Responsible, Omitted (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACI)

// .More Information

// https://docs.req42.de/section-xxx in the online documentation

.tpo42 Integration
Role definitions here should align with the solution strategy from arc42 Chapter 4. Technology choices drive required skills and team composition.

=== Budget

Budget covers development resources for:

Personnel costs:: Development team and technical roles
Infrastructure:: Development tools, testing equipment, workspace
Production setup:: Initial prototyping and testing capabilities
External resources:: Third-party services, consulting, outsourcing

.Content
Resource planning and capacity allocation. This complements stakeholder information from Chapter 2 by focusing on availability and capacity rather than roles and responsibilities.

==== Role Definitions

[role="req42help"]
****
.Content
Detailed skill requirements and responsibilities for roles needed based on solution strategy. These roles should be derived from architectural decisions and technology choices made in arc42 Chapter 4.

.Motivation
Technology choices (Qt vs. web technologies, embedded vs. cloud-native) determine required skill sets. Define these requirements clearly to ensure proper team composition and identify skill gaps.

.Content
Impediment management for technical resources. Identify gaps and available equipment to prevent development blockers.

.Motivation
Technical infrastructure gaps can block development progress. Early identification enables proactive procurement or workaround planning.
