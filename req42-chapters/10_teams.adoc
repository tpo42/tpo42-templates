== Teams

[role="req42help"]
****
.Content
This section can be omitted for small product developments with only one development team, since the team members are already listed in the previous section.

For scaled large products, the organization chart of your teams should be here and an assignment to the topics (e.g. epics, features, ...) this team is responsible for.

.Motivation
If you have more than one team at your disposal, it goes without saying that you should have an overview of who works in which (sub-)team and how these teams are organized.

The focus should be on (sub-)teams being organized in such a way that they can deliver functions/features or partial products as independently as possible without having to constantly coordinate with everyone else.

.Team Organization Options
Modern organizations typically use:

* **Product Teams (vertical)**: Cross-functional teams with end-to-end product responsibility
* **Communities of Practice (CoPs/Guilds)**: Horizontal knowledge sharing for cross-cutting concerns (security, compliance, architecture)
* **Dedicated Service Teams**: Specialized teams providing services to product teams (legal, PMO, platform teams)
* **Hybrid Approaches**: Combination based on organizational needs

.Notations/Tools
Lists of teams (each with assigned people and assigned topics from the roadmap or from the product backlog (e.g., epics or features).

.tpo42 Integration
Team structure influences architectural decisions and should align with solution strategy from arc42 Chapter 4. Team boundaries often become system boundaries (Conway's Law).
