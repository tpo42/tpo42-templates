== Quality Requirements

[role="req42help"]
****
.Content
Quality requirements are the "how" to the "what" - qualitative definitions or precisions of the functional requirements.

.Motivation
Our experience shows: Quality requirements are (unfortunately) still severely underestimated, not only in the agile world. Everyone wants good quality products and services, but only a few make it explicit what exactly is meant by this.

Some quality requirements (such as response times) can perhaps be integrated directly into a story (or added as an acceptance criterion). However, the vast majority of quality requirements relate to many, if not all, of the functional requirements in the product backlog.

Therefore, as a product owner, you need somewhere to specify and assign the desired qualities of your products and services. For this activity, industry-proven checklists (such as ISO 25010 and others) are available to help you quickly identify and manage the most important categories.

.Approach
Start with the ISO 25010 quality model mindmap below. Focus only on quality aspects that are relevant to your business goals from Chapter 1. Remove all irrelevant categories - be ruthless in cutting what doesn't matter for your specific product and goals.

.Notations/Tools
Simple textual scenarios, possibly structured according to the sections of Q42, or the ISO 25010 quality tree, or according to VOLERE.

.tpo42 Integration
Quality requirements defined here will be filtered and prioritized:
* Top 3-5 most architecturally critical quality goals → arc42 Chapter 1 Section 3 (Quality Goals)
* Complete detailed quality requirements → arc42 Chapter 10 (Quality Requirements)

Use this as a checklist and starting point. Remove quality characteristics that are not relevant to your business goals.

=== Quality Requirements

[role="req42help"]
****
For each relevant quality characteristic from the ISO 25010 model above, define specific requirements using the structured format below. Link each requirement back to the business goals that drive it.
****

==== _<Quality Characteristic 1>_

Business Requirement::
_<Specific quality requirement in measurable terms>_

Business Justification::
_<Reference to business goal(s) from Chapter 1 and background/context>_

Acceptance Criteria::
* _<Scenario 1: Given... When... Then...>_
* _<Scenario 2: Measurable criteria>_
* _<Scenario 3: Performance targets>_

Business Impact if not achieved::
* _<Customer impact>_
* _<Business impact>_
* _<Technical impact>_
* _<Market impact>_

==== _<Quality Characteristic 2>_

Business Requirement::
