.Content
(Prioritized) lists of risks you have identified and a list of assumptions you have made as a basis for decisions.

.Motivation
"Risk management is project management for adults" says Tim Lister of the Atlantic Systems Guild".

With this in mind, you should keep your risks under control as a product owner.

req42 provides you with the means to consciously manage risks. Especially when prioritizing your requirements you should balance business value and risk reduction.

.Notations/Tools
Simple tables or lists are often already sufficient.

// .More Information

// https://docs.req42.de/section-xxx in the online documentation

.tpo42 Integration
Business risks identified here complement technical risks in arc42 Chapter 11 (Technical Risks). Risk mitigation strategies may influence architectural decisions and solution strategy.
